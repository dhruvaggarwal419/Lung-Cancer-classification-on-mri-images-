Lung Cancer Classification on MRI Images
This machine learning project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI images for lung cancer detection. The model has been trained on a dataset specifically designed for identifying lung cancer from MRI scans. Users can upload MRI images, and the model will predict whether the image indicates the presence of lung cancer.

Project Overview
Model: The Convolutional Neural Network model has been carefully designed and trained to accurately classify MRI images for lung cancer detection.

Dataset: The dataset includes MRI images labeled for lung cancer detection.

User Interface: Streamlit is used to create a simple and interactive user interface where users can upload MRI images and view predictions.

Running the Application: To run the application, navigate to the directory containing your project files in VS Code or any other terminal. Use the following command to start the app:

streamlit run app.py
The dataset initially contains a total of 4,318 MRI images. To enhance the dataset, data augmentation techniques were applied, allowing the model to learn more accurately and predict results with greater precision.
